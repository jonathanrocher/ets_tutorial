# Hello world in ETS pyface!
This folder contains a "hello world" application using ETS' pyface package. To 
execute it, 
- an application object defines a custom application next to a `main.py` script 
  which executes it. 
- The content of the application is a single Task which contains a single 
  TraitsUI-based pane displaying a model's string content.

Optional: If you want to get ahead, continue on and add a dock pane (still 
traitsUI based) which displays "hello world" as a left side panel.
